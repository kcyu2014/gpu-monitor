# GPU Monitor

### About this fork

This is a fork used by the [CVLAB](https://cvlab.epfl.ch/) lab. We only adapt some of the script to our architecture and try to stick with the original. We try to rebase on the upstream as often as possible. We keep track of the changes we introduced:

- auto detection of iccluster nodes in `index.php`
- docker deployment in `docker/`

Orignal README below.

This is a tool intended to monitor the GPU usage on the various GPU-servers at the LIP6 Lab, UPMC, Paris. This code has been written with the "quickest and dirtiest" principle in mind, it is absolutely awful, please do not read it :persevere:

The principle is as follows. A bunch of Bash / Python scripts runs regularly `nvidia-smi` and `ps` to extract data and sends them to my `public_html` space. Each time someone wants to see the status of the GPUs, the page `index.php` reads the latest data files for each server and displays those.

## How to setup

### Monitoring setup

Put the files that are in the `scripts` folder on the machines you want to monitor. The scripts are as follows:

* `gpu-run.sh <task_id>` loops on one of the three tasks (`task_id` being `1`, `2` or `3`). Task 1 extracts GPU usage stats each 20s, task 2 extracts GPU processes each 20s, task 3 extracts ps info tha corresponds to GPU processes each 10s and copies all the monitoring files to the `public_html` space. This scripts uses the `HOST` env variable.
* `gpu-processes.py` is what's ran by task 3
* `gpu-check.sh <hostname>` checks if the 3 tasks are running, if not it will launch them in the background. Also `gpu-check.sh kill` will stop the tasks if running.

Just edit `gpu-run.sh` to change the `scp` command that is in it so that it sends file to the right location (i.e. the `data` folder of the _www_ location of the web monitor). If you do need scp, make sure you have an SSH keys setup so that we can do passwordless copy.

Ideally, on the machines you want to monitor, use the following cron jobs:

```
# Edit full-caps infos below
# Check if monitoring running each 5 min
*/5 * * * * /SCRIPT-LOCATION/gpu-check.sh HOSTNAME > /dev/null 2>&1
# Kill and restart the monitoring each 2 hours to cleanup the ouptput files of the monitors
0 */2 * * * /SCRIPT-LOCATION/gpu-check.sh kill > /dev/null 2>&1; /SCRIPT-LOCATION/gpu-check.sh HOSTNAME > /dev/null 2>&1
```

### Web interface setup

To setup the web interface, you just need to put the files of the repo (except `scripts` folder) on the www space of a web server that supports PHP.

Simply edit the `index.php` file to each the `$HOSTS` variable and optionnaly the `$SHORT_GPU_NAMES` variable.

`$HOSTS` associates the hostnames with some viewable names for these hosts. The keys are the ones entered as `HOSTNAME` in the crontab above and the `<hostname>` parameter of `gpu-check`.

`$SHORT_GPU_NAMES` allows you to rewrite GPU names if you want. It associates the names given by `nvidia-smi` to the names you want to be displayed.
